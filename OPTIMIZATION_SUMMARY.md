## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation Patterns

### Multi-Stage Build Architecture
All optimizations followed a consistent pattern:

```dockerfile
# Build stage - Full development environment
FROM ghcr.io/kengggg/petribench-base:latest AS builder
# Install compilers, build tools, SDKs
# Copy source code
# Compile/build programs

# Runtime stage - Minimal execution environment
FROM ghcr.io/kengggg/petribench-base:latest
# Install only runtime dependencies
# Copy compiled artifacts from builder
# Remove all build tools and dependencies
```

### Key Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Build tools separate from runtime environment
2. **Static Compilation**: Where possible (Rust, C, C++), create standalone binaries
3. **Minimal Runtime**: Only install packages needed for execution
4. **Preserved Functionality**: Maintain full compatibility with existing workflows
5. **Extensibility**: Keep full Debian environment for apt-get extensions

## üîß Infrastructure Improvements

### GitHub Actions Workflows
- **Updated size targets** for all images based on actual optimized sizes
- **Improved test commands** to work with multi-stage builds
- **Consistent CI/CD patterns** across all language workflows

### Build Scripts
- **Updated `build-individual.sh`** with proper multi-stage testing
- **Fixed test patterns** for compiled vs interpreted languages
- **Improved error handling** and validation

### Documentation
- **Updated README.md** with accurate size information
- **Consistent usage examples** for all optimized images
- **Clear migration guidance** for existing users

## üé® User Experience Improvements

### Backwards Compatibility
- **All existing workflows continue to work** without changes
- **Same entry points and commands** maintained
- **Volume mounts work identically** to previous versions

### Performance Benefits
- **Faster container startup** due to smaller image sizes
- **Reduced network transfer** for image pulls
- **Better Docker layer caching** during builds
- **Lower storage requirements** for image registries

## üìà Business Impact

### Cost Reduction
- **Registry storage costs** reduced by ~42% for all images
- **Network bandwidth** savings for image pulls
- **Build time improvements** through better layer caching

## üîç Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Runtime Configuration Issues
**Problem**: .NET assemblies needed runtime configuration files  
**Solution**: Copy both .dll and .runtimeconfig.json files in build stage

### Test Pattern Updates
**Problem**: Build scripts tested for compilers removed in runtime stage  
**Solution**: Updated tests to check binary execution instead of compiler presence

### Package Manager Preservation
**Problem**: Removing npm/pip would break development workflows  
**Solution**: Preserved package managers in runtime for development flexibility
